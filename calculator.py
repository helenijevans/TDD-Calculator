# TDD PROCESS
# first step - making a main method that takes in an input and then routes
# first step tests: ALL FAIL (6)
# - calling router function with equation and expecting a correct result (at the moment returning 0 for all)
# - calling router function with an invalid format and expect error message

# second step - adding and routing operator functions (which all return 0) and throwing exception in router
#               adding new tests to check correct flow from routing function
# second step tests: 1 PASS; 10 FAIL
# - calling router function with an invalid format and expect error message (PASSES)
# - calling operator functions and expecting a correct result (at the moment returning 0 for all)
# - flow tests replicate behaviour above and hence fail

# third step - changing operators logic to return correct calculation
# third step tests: 11 PASS
# - calling router function with an invalid format and expect error message (PASSES)
# - calling operator functions and expecting a correct result (PASS)
# - flow tests (PASS)

# fourth step - issue realised with dividing by 0
# fourth step tests: create new test case for dividing by 0
# 11 PASS, 1 FAIL (test_divide_by_zero)

# fifth step - add Exception Handling for that situation
# 12 TESTS PASS; DONE
